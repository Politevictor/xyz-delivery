# # XYZ DELIVERY CUSTOMER'S LOCATION/BASE

xyz business is growing speedly and the board of directors has aggreed to open two new branches,
but it was said to be on the situated on the locations where the have the highest number of customers,
and the second criteria for this is that the majority will exclude the "lower class customers".

# Address, location_count
'Okuokoko', '134'
'Osubi', '49'
'Jakpa', '19'
'Opete', '19'
'Pti', '14'
'Refinary road', '1'
'Ekpan', '1'

  from the customers location count we have 'Okuokokoubi' ranking first, however with the second criteria 'Okuokoko' falls under the 'lower class cstomer' with thirty-three and twenty-sixorders,
  while 'jakpa' which rank third have three of the four 'first class customers' and three of the six 'middle class customers'.
  Hence board of direction made the data_driven decsion to station the new branches in 'Jakpa' and 'Osubi' as it fall in the first and middle class.
